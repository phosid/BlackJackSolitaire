# BlackJackSolitaire
A console-based black jack solitaire game created as a final project for intro to programming course based on OOP

# How to run the program and play the game:
Simply run main and the game will begin. You will play the game entirely through the console!

# Improvements:
- I hope to develop an iOS app based on this game some time soon.
